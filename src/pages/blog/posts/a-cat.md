This is my cat, I honestly don't know how I got into cats, but I loved this one, he is the youngest of his siblings, he was born on May the Force, he lost his right eye which makes him not so skilled at climbing or peeling on the roofs so he spends more time with me and interrupting important meetings while I have my camera on.
