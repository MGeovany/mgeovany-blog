I am more of a pc gamer, however consoles were part of my childhood so I feel nostalgic when playing with controller and games that are not multiplayer in which I must be a character and complete missions in adventure games.

I bought the PlayStation 5 because I was ready to take my gaming experience to the next level! I had been hearing all the hype about the PS5's powerful hardware and lightning-fast load times, and I was eager to see for myself what all the fuss was about. And let me tell you, I was not disappointed! The moment I fired up my PS5 and started playing one of my favorite games, I was blown away by the smooth and immersive gameplay. The graphics were so realistic and vibrant, it was like I had been transported into another world.
