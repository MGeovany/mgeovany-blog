I have this one especially for the Zelda breath of the wild game which I thought was quite innovative at the time, as well as more games that will be added in the future, such as the upcoming Pokemon releases.

It is always part of my gadgets when I go on a trip or when I want to distract myself a little.

I bought the Nintendo Switch because I wanted a gaming console that I could take with me anywhere and everywhere. Whether I'm on the go, at home on the couch, or hanging out with friends, the Switch is the perfect choice.

But what I love most about the Switch is its incredible library of games. From classic Nintendo franchises like Mario and Zelda to new indie darlings like Celeste and Hollow Knight, there's something for everyone. Plus, with online multiplayer and the ability to play with friends and family, the Switch has brought so much joy and fun into my life.
